### Stormlight Labs ⚡️

Welcome to the Github page for Stormlight Labs. We're aiming to be a beacon for
mental health and education by building open-source tools to help curious people
thrive.

#### Current Projects

We've got a few big projects in the works!

One is an implementation of the Language Server Protocol for Python and a
static type-checker.

We've started designing set of tools that help you write, and collect your notes 
(zettlekasten style) with [asciidoc](https://asciidoc.org/), with the primary focus being 
a desktop app.

Another is an app to help you build custom trackers on mobile devices, with an emphasis
on an extensible API and an entirely [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) implementation.
